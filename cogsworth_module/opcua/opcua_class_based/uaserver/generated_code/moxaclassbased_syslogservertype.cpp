/** Construction of the class SyslogServerType.
 This constructor is used if the object is created based on an instance declaration of an object type. Since the only difference between the
 instance declaration object and the instance object are the node id, the pointer to the instance declaration node is used to get the attribute
 values other than NodeId from the instance declaration node.

 The object is reference counted and can not be deleted directly. The reference counter is set to one after the object is created.
 If the object was successfully added to a NodeManager using the methods NodeManagerConfig::addUaNode or NodeManagerConfig::addNodeAndReference the
 NodeManager will release this reference during shut down. If the object was not added to a NodeManager, it must be deleted using the releaseReference
 method. If the interface pointer is used in other places, the availability of the object must be ensured by incrementing the reference counter with
 addReference when the pointer is stored somewhere and decremented with releaseReference if the interface pointer is not longer needed.
