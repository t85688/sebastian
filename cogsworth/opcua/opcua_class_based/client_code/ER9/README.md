# Overview

This sample code provides scripts: `class_based_client_test.py`

The purpose of these scripts is to demonstrate how to use the opcua Python library to create an `OPC UA client application that can interact with an OPC UA server.

## Environment

To use these scripts, you'll need to have `Python 3.7 or later` installed, along with the opcua library. You can install the library and its dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

To run these scripts, you can use the following commands:

"""
python.exe class_based_client_test.py
"""

The `class_based_client_test.py` script demonstrates how to use the opcua library to create a new OPC UA project and establish topology in an `offline environment`. It reads configuration information from the `offline_single_tsn_device.json` file and uses it to create a new project.

## Summary

Overall, these sample scripts provide a useful starting point for creating your own OPC UA client applications using Python and the opcua library.
